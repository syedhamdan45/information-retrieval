# Information Retrieval Project

The dataset used in the project includes test collection which is about 4,000 documents from US Government web sites and the topics/query are 15 needs for government information. Both were part of the TREC conference in 2003. The aim of the project is to run Whoosh on a large document collection for certain queries and approve on the baseline model.

Three important softwares used:
- Whoosh, a pure-Python search engineering library, 
- NLTK, a natural language processing toolkit and 
- pytrec eval, an Information Retrieval evaluation tool for Python, based  on the popular trec eval, the standard software for evaluating search engines with test collections.
